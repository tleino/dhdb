dhdb - Multi-format dynamic and hierarchical database for C
Copyright (c) 2015 Tommi M. Leino <tleino@me.com>

This library provides an in-memory object system that adds
dynamic, scripting language-like ease to the C programming
language. The original intention was to use this API for
adding JSON support to programs, but a modular approach
made it possible, at the same time, to support importing the
state from, and exporting to, various standard compliant
formats in addition to JSON, such as INI. It is easy to add
new import / export modules by following the existing modules.

If you want to use this library for example for JSON, take
dhdb.c and dhdb_json.c, and the respective headers, nothing else
is needed. For INI support, take the dhdb_ini.c, etc.

The Makefile requires GNU make, but you can easily take the
relevant files and integrate to your build systems.

Design goals:
* Permissive license
* Low overhead
* Modular
* Portable

Optional features:
* Path API (dhdb_path)
* Import and export JSON (dhdb_json)
* Import and export INI format files (dhdb_ini)
* Dump object contents with memory usage information (dhdb_dump)

Features that are under implementation:
* Import and export XML (dhdb_xml)

Features that may be implemented later:
* Import and export BSON (dhdb_bson)
* Import and export UBJSON (dhdb_ubjson)
* Import and export RFC822 headers (dhdb_header)
